# Final Project

Sprint six (sadly the last sprint), it's time for our final projects. We're going to build one bigger application during these next four weeks (approx 20 hours/week).

The Technical Requirements are:

- Frontend in React (Redux optional)
- Backend in Node.js
- MongoDB database
- Navigation using React Router
- Should work in Chrome, Firefox & Safari
- Be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet and phone

I've decided to do this project on my own.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
